        <p><h3>Mission</h3><h6>Dognate conects dog owners and organizations that are in need of supplies. Dognate helps organizations and dog owners to exchange, donate or volunteer where help is most needed.</h6><p>
          
          <h3><p>How Dognate works</h3><p>
        <p><h6>* Some dog rescue organizations lack time or resources to obtain needed supplies. Generous pet owners can help by picking up and dropping off supplies. 
        <br>* Low-income families that are responsible dog owners might not have the proper supplies for their dogs, or are in need of some. Dognate connects people with supplies to people that need them.
        <br>* Some dog organizations are in need of bedding, blankets etc, since their services are done outdoors.
        Pet stores that have extra supplies assist our mission to make sure every dog has what they need for a happy life.
        <br>* FUTURE: crowd funding donations of money where needed.</h6>

  
        <p><h3>Volunteer</h3><p><h6>
        People with skills that can be useful such as engineers, electricians, plumbers, painters, etc. -- anyone, really, who can lend a hand to help people or dog organizations that might be in need for any kind of help can find volunteer opportunities.<p></h6>
